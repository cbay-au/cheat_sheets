**Enumeration Modes**

**Enumeration Options**

To use WPScan's enumeration capabilities supply the -e option.
The following enumeration options exist:

    vp (Vulnerable plugins)
    ap (All plugins)
    p (Popular plugins)
    vt (Vulnerable themes)
    at (All themes)
    t (Popular themes)
    tt (Timthumbs)
    cb (Config backups)
    dbe (Db exports)
    u (User IDs range. e.g: u1-5)
    m (Media IDs range. e.g m1-15)

If no option is supplied to the -e flag, then the default will be: vp,vt,tt,cb,dbe,u,m

Here we have put together a bunch of common commands that will help you get started quickly.

NOTE: Get your API token from wpscan.com if you also want the vulnerabilities associated with the detected plugin displaying.
Enumerate all plugins with known vulnerabilities

wpscan --url example.com -e vp --plugins-detection mixed --api-token YOUR_TOKEN
Enumerate all plugins in our database (could take a very long time)

wpscan --url example.com -e ap --plugins-detection mixed --api-token YOUR_TOKEN
Password brute force attack

wpscan --url example.com -e u --passwords /path/to/password_file.txt
The remote website is up, but does not seem to be running WordPress

If you get the Scan Aborted: The remote website is up, but does not seem to be running WordPress. error, it means that for some reason WPScan did not think that the site you are trying to scan is actually WordPress. If you think WPScan is wrong, you can supply the --force option to force WPScan to scan the site regardless. You may also need to set other options in this case, such as --wp-content-dir and --wp-plugins-dir.
Redirects

By default WPScan will follow in scope redirects, unless the --ignore-main-redirect option is given.

**Bypassing Simple WAFs**
To bypass some simple WAFs you can try the --random-user-agent option.
